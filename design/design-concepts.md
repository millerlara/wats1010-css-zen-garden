# Design Concepts

## Concept/Theme
The concept for my redesign of the CSS Zen Garden revolves around a very simple koi pond-inspired design. The design itself will be 
very minimal: a blank background with artistically-rendered koi and lily pad, text, in a simple font, floating in the middle of the page. 
The design is meant to be simple and soothing, channeling the zen essence of a quiet koi pond. The koi will be placed throughout to 
give the illusion they are floating on the page. 

Some notes on the design include: 
+ The design, archive, and resource links may either neutral, hover buttons or links with styling. It is still undecided what
will work best with the design once CSS work begins.  
+ The text will either be placed directly on the page or floated above to scroll independently of the static background. If I can make
it work, I may try to make the text static and the images move to give the illusion of the fish swimming. This may be beyond my current 
abilities, however. 
+ Style links (HTML, CSS, A11y, GH) will likely be icons.

## Design Impact
For this design I wanted to use a simple but calming scheme which lends itself to easy-to-use content. Some of the best web 
designs I have seen and best websites I have used are very basic--the design does not overpower the content and the content layout 
is straightforward. Many of the example designs are incredibly busy. While many of them are also very impressive and visually pleasing,
they can also best very overwhelming. In my redesign I wanted to get away from the potency of many of these designs and create a 
bare-bones page which encourages the user to relax (whether they realize it or not!). Becauses the content itself is very basic and 
does not itself have a theme, it was easy to strip down my design in this way.
